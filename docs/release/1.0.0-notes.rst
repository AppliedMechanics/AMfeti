AMfeti 1.0.0 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights of this release
--------------------------

The AMfeti package is totally based on PyFETI originally developed by Guilherme Jenovencio. After an extensive
refactoring it evolved to the new AMfeti package. PyFETI provides an open-source FETI-package with everything, needed to
solve a system, decomposed into several subdomains, with a FETI-method either in a serial iterative or parallel mannor.
With the new refactoring, the overall structure of AMfeti became more decoupled into several subpackages and is
therefore much more flexible for sustainable development. Moreover the refactoring aimed to apply the same style-guide,
as adopted in our AMfe-package.

New features
============

amfeti.coarse_grid improvements
-------------------------------

- Added separate module for natural coarse grid and projection


amfeti.config_base improvements
--------------------------------

- Generalized configuration-management in ConfigBase-class


amfeti.feti_solvers improvements
--------------------------------

- Created linear static FETI-solver for linear non-time-dependent problems
- Created nonlinear static FETI-solver for nonlinear non-time-dependent problems
- Created linear dynamic FETI-solver for linear time-dependent problems
- Created nonlinear dynamic FETI-solver for nonlinear time-dependent problems


amfeti.local_problems improvements
----------------------------------

- Established a new structure for local problems originating from a basic local problem. This way several types of
  local problems can be created in the future.
- Linear static local problem has a preconditioner- and scaling-object
- Added nonlinear local problem
- Added linear dynamic local problem
- Added base-class for integrator-class that is required by dynamic local problems
- Added nonlinear dynamic local problem


amfeti.nonlinear_solvers improvements
-------------------------------------

- Added NewtonRaphson nonlinear solver as a general nonlinear solver


amfeti.parallelization_managers improvements
--------------------------------------------

- Created Manager-modules for parallel MPI-solvers
- Created local MPI-processor
- MPI-system supports free configurable distribution of local problems among available MPI-ranks


amfeti.preconditioner improvements
----------------------------------

- Moved out preconditioner-module, such that the src-folder can become obsolete


amfeti.scaling improvements
---------------------------

- Created new scaling-module and outsourced Multiplicity-scaling from the local problem. This way new scaling-types can
  be implemented easily


amfeti.solver_managers improvements
-----------------------------------

- Refactored serial solver-manager
- Added parallel solver-manager


amfeti.solvers improvements
---------------------------

- Created new class-based solver-structure for solvers of global problems
- PCPG refactored
- PCPG supports full reorthogonalization
- Added GMRES
- Added ORTHOMIN

amfeti.tools improvements
-------------------------

- Added methods to invert dictionaries
- Added method to get path to amfeti-folder
